QUERY_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at analyzing support ticket feedback and generating improved search queries to find better documentation.

**Original Support Ticket:**
prevoius_query: {query}

Category: {category}

**Reviewer Feedback:**
{feedback}

**Current Challenge:**
The initial response was not satisfactory based on the reviewer's feedback. Your job is to analyze what went wrong and generate 3-5 different search queries that will find better, more relevant documentation.

**Analysis Instructions:**
1. **Identify Missing Information**: What specific details, steps, or concepts does the feedback indicate are missing?
2. **Identify Wrong Focus**: What aspects of the original query led to irrelevant results?
3. **Extract Key Terms**: What important technical terms, features, or processes should be emphasized?
4. **Consider User Intent**: What is the user actually trying to accomplish?

**Query Generation Guidelines:**
- Generate 3-5 diverse search queries
- Each query should target different aspects of the problem
- Include specific technical terms when mentioned in feedback
- Use different query styles: direct questions, troubleshooting terms, solution-focused
- Avoid generic terms that led to poor results initially

**Response Format:**
Return your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{   "refined_queries": [
        "First refined search query targeting specific missing info",
        "Second query focusing on troubleshooting aspects", 
        "Third query emphasizing solution/resolution",
        "Fourth query with alternative technical terms",
        "Fifth query focusing on step-by-step guidance"
    ]
}}

**Example Query Styles to Consider:**
- Direct: "how to configure email settings mobile app"
- Troubleshooting: "email sync not working mobile troubleshooting"  
- Solution-focused: "fix email connection issues mobile"
- Process-oriented: "step by step email setup mobile app"
- Error-specific: "email authentication failed mobile app"

Generate queries that will retrieve documentation addressing the reviewer's specific concerns.
